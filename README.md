# Expenses Report - Summary

This is a simple Jupyter Notebook, leveraging Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to read in an excel (.xls) spendings file containing each month's spendings based on the categories
- Bills/Taxes
- Transportation
- Grocery
- Other
- Food
- Shopping
- Leisure
- Drinks
- Subscriptions
- Rent
- Vacation

Each month has its own excel sheet with its respective spendings. The algorithms allow the user to choose between different options to view different types of analytics in regards to a specific month or all present months (not limited to a specific year). Examples of these are, a line graph showing the total spending for all months (based on the number of sheets available), which category has the most spending in a given month (chosen by the user), line graph showing how a category spending curve has been during all months, and more.

# How to run
You can either use Anaconda to run the Jupyter Notebook, or drag and rop the **spendings** folder into the VScode IDE, select the Python environment and simply run the notebook.
